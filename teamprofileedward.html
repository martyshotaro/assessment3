<h4 style="font-family:candara">Hobbies and facts about me:</h4> 

<p style="font-family:candara">Much of my life has been enveloped in sport, particularly as the rest has been purely academic. Other than the aforementioned sporting activities I continuously participate in, I have always enjoyed nature and spending time outside.</p>

<p style="font-family:candara">Some of the extraordinary activities are fishing and camping, but it is difficult to find the time to put aside for these in particular.</p>

<p style="font-family:candara">Lastly, I appreciate nature, and the greatly respected David Attenborough. David is quite a vocal point in the natural world, and provides me with inspiration to make the world better.</p>
