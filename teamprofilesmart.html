<h4 style="font-family:verdana">Background information:</h4>
<p style="font-family:verdana">I’m 20 years old, I’m Filipino, I’m around 5 ft. 7 inches (around 173cm) and I’m born in the 3rd of December 1999 at Davao City, Philippines.</p>

<h4 style="font-family:verdana">Education to date:</h4>
<p style="font-family:verdana">31/08/2020</p>

<h4 style="font-family:verdana">Languages:</h4>
<p style="font-family:verdana">I speak two main languages, which are Tagalog and English, and I used to speak one of the dialects in Philippines, which is Visaya when I was around eight, but completely forgot it as soon as I arrived in Australia in 2010. Nowadays, I’m learning Korean, Bahasa (Indonesia), and a bit of Japanese.</p>

<h4 style="font-family:verdana">Hobbies:</h4>
<p style="font-family:verdana">My hobbies and interest include basketball, music (mainly Korean rap/rnb, indie, neo soul, and modern/old school rap and rnb), going to aesthetically pleasing food places that are good, watching Korean drama, and computer games (mainly MMORPG like League of Legends). Also, I resell clothes and shoes from sites that include Grailed, Depop, StockX and etc. Also, I mainly develop and shoot 35mm film shots of my inspirations and captured moments from particular concepts (e.g. watching my NBA team winning a championship in the arena, or music videos of my favourite artists).</p> 
  
<h4 style="font-family:verdana">Facts about me:</h4> 
<p style="font-family:verdana">I’m a reserved person at first, which means that I’m like a “one you get to know me” type of person. Because of this, I shy away from meeting new people but once you get to know me, I’m more lively and energetic than you’d expect Also, I make everyone feel with ease. Also, I’m in a church choir that sings bass as their assigned voice type and I’m a son of a pastor of a local Filipino church. Lastly, I like dogs and Japanese hedgehogs nowadays because I find them cute.</p>
