<h4 style="font-family:candara">Background information:</h4>
<p style="font-family:candara">I’m 20 years old, I’m Filipino, I’m around 5 ft. 7 inches (around 173cm) and I’m born on the 3rd of December 1999 at Davao City, Philippines.</p>

<h4 style="font-family:candara">Education to date:</h4>
<p style="font-family:candara">31/08/2020</p>

<h4 style="font-family:candara">Languages:</h4>
<p style="font-family:candara">I speak two main languages, which are Tagalog and English, and I used to speak one of the dialects in the Philippines, which is Visaya when I was around eight, but completely forgot it as soon as I arrived in Australia in 2010. Nowadays, I’m learning Korean, Bahasa (Indonesia), and a bit of Japanese.</p>

<h4 style="font-family:candara">Hobbies:</h4>
<p style="font-family:candara">My hobbies and interest include basketball, music (mainly Korean rap/rnb, indie, neo soul, and modern/old school rap and rnb), going to aesthetically pleasing food places that are good, watching Korean drama, and computer games (mainly MMORPG like League of Legends). Also, I resell clothes and shoes from sites that include Grailed, Depop, StockX and etc. Also, I mainly develop and shoot 35mm film shots of my inspirations and captured moments from particular concepts (e.g. watching my NBA team winning a championship in the arena, or music videos of my favourite artists).</p> 
  
<h4 style="font-family:candara">Facts about me:</h4> 
<p style="font-family:candara">I’m a reserved person at first, which means that I’m like a “one you get to know me” type of person. Because of this, I shy away from meeting new people but once you get to know me, I’m more lively and energetic than you’d expect. Also, I make everyone feel with ease. Also, I’m in a church choir that sings bass as their assigned voice type and I’m a son of a pastor of a local Filipino church. Lastly, I like dogs and Japanese hedgehogs nowadays because I find them cute.</p>  

<br>

<h3 style="font-family:candara">Group Processes</h3>

<p style="font-family:candara">In terms of our overall effort in A2, I think we did well as a group even if it only consists of two members, including me. There were undermanned circumstances, work, and personal and family commitments that affected the assignment in terms of the components that were done, what needs to be done, better communication, pull requests in the GitHub repository, and setting up meetings via MS Teams but we pulled through and finished it on time. Also, in some of the components from A2 like ideal jobs, team profile and project idea, there will be no changes that will be made. However, time will tell if there will be adjustments that need to be made for the other components that I didn’t mention.</p>

<h4 style="font-family:candara">Compare and contrast the ideal jobs for each person in the group.</h4>

For Edward, his job consists of helping other individuals in terms of experience and developing a social culture that will result in a successful working environment.

<p style="font-family:candara">For my position/job, there’s only one common element, which is a benefit that includes a 12 month contract that could go permanent.

<br>

<h4 style="font-family:candara">What differentiates each position from the others, if anything?</h4>

<p style="font-family:candara">In my opinion, the noticeable differences between my position and Edward’s position are the roles and the aspects of the jobs that we focus on for the benefit and improvement of the working environment and overall success.  I’m a system admin in IT support, which mainly focuses on the networking aspect of IT such as developing technical skills in terms of operating systems that include desktop and server, creating an excellent overall operating environment, and the development of appropriate technical documentation knowledge in Systems protocols that include TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, Group Policy, VOIP, Active Directory and routing protocols.</p>

<br>

<h4 style="font-family:candara">How similar or different are your career plans across the group?</h4>  
  
<p style="font-family:candara">In terms of similarity, there are some similarities for me and Edward’s career plans due to the degree of difficulty of our career paths that we chose for ourselves. For being a system administrator, it requires a particular person, dedication, experience, and integrity. Sometimes, being a system admin will take you around the years of working up the ladder to become a good system admin. For being an investment adviser, it’s included as one of the highest stress rates in the industry. Starting this career can result in a great deal of stress, as this career is deeply associated with the performance of global and domestic markets. Lastly, investment advisers are managing the client’s emotions constantly during the downturns in the market that can result in a high level of stress over time.</p>
  
<p style="font-family:candara">In terms of differences, there are some noticeable ones from our career paths chosen that include a completely different field, study, and requirements that will be needed for a potential employment. For example, for being a system admin in IT support, completing the course of Bachelor of Information Technology, Major in Networking & Security is needed, or a degree in Bachelor of Information Technology (Honours) as an alternative whereas being an investment advisor, completing the RG146 Training Course via an undergraduate degree in Financial Planning, and series of examinations that is split in three parts of your study is needed to be a qualified Actuary by being recognised by the Institute of Actuarial Studies.</p>
