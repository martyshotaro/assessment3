<p style="font-family:candara">The project that I’ve chosen is called “Mini Fling It In!” which I made from A1 until now. This will be made from a site called MIT app inventor. The key features of this game consist of flicking the ball to a particular area, but there are obstacles that include 2D rectangle lines and they’re immobile throughout the duration of the game in order to get the ball through to succeed and win the game. Lastly, it’s recommended for Android smartphone users since it’s more accessible to connect your Android device from your project or game through MIT app inventor, and can also be played from your computer via the emulator, located at the top of the design editor section.</p>

<h3 style="font-family:candara">Motivation</h3>

<p style="font-family:candara">This would be a handy and an interesting game for individuals due to the fun aspect of it even if it were just a simple game; it takes away your stress, especially if you had a long day from work, studies etc. This app is a perfect way to relax. Lastly, another interesting part of this is the low level of complexity and difficulty of this app/game, which indicates that it can be played by anyone of any ages. Statistics show that 6.8 million people around 190 countries have used this app inventor to create more than 24 million apps, which indicates as a good sign for both developers and consumers.</p> 
  
<p style="font-family:candara">This game will fit in with the IT trends in our modern era today (specifically in the Internet of Things [IoT]) because gaming in general incorporates the ways in which individuals connect to the devices of their friends, and others (Wallace 2003). In this case, individuals can connect to this game through the use of the App Inventor, which allows you to develop applications for Android and Apple smartphones via a web browser and also through the “emulator” feature. The emulator allows individuals to test and develop apps using a virtual phone instead of your smartphone. Instead of connecting a phone to the USB port, just start the emulator program. When you click Connect to Phone in the Blocks Editor, your app will appear in front of you in the emulator.</p>
