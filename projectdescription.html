<h2 style="font-family:candara">Project Description</h3>

<h3 style="font-family:candara">The passions, interests and skills of your group</h3>

<p style="font-family:candara">My passions, interests, and skills include being on a computer throughout the majority of the duration of the day. I just love everything about computers in general. It can either be in gaming, coding, practising and refining my programming skills in the likes of HTML, CSS, Java and will advance to more complex programming languages that include C++,  or Python, making YouTube videos (coming soon), and many more. I love working on a system admin/networking based IT firm after I receive my bachelors in the future. Lastly, the skills that I obtain that are IT related include making GitHub repository/pages by uploading visual elements that include images, and the use of Notepad, Visual Code Learner and Brackets to make a HTML/CSS index file (e.g. “index.html”).</p>

<h3 style="font-family:candara">IT industry trends</h3>

<h3 style="font-family:candara">What would assist you in your career plan?</h3>

<p style="font-family:candara">The things that would assist me in my career plan (in being a system administrator) include obtaining baseline skills that include problem solving, organisational skills, communication skills, teamwork/collaboration, troubleshooting, research, resourcefulness, enthusiasm, creativity, analytical skills, and project management. Also, technical skills are a must that will vary job to job such as training; hands-on experiences like volunteering or doing side work from your computer.</p>
  
<p style="font-family:candara">Also, the IT-specific skills that are compulsory that will assist me in being a system admin include technical support and LINUX (which refers to an open-source operating system that is widely used that receives requests from programs and it also relays the requests to a computer’s hardware).</p>  
  
<p style="font-family:candara">Also, the development of technical skills in terms of operating systems will definitely assist me in being a successful system admin that include desktop and server, creating an excellent overall operating environment, and the development of appropriate technical documentation knowledge in Systems protocols that include TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, Group Policy, VOIP, Active Directory and routing protocols.</p>  
  
<p style="font-family:candara">Also, in creating an excellent operating environment, the development of appropriate technical documentation, and the experience in terms of administering the service desk and IT support ticketing systems will also assist me in being successful in my overall career plan as a system admin.</p>   
  
<p style="font-family:candara">Lastly, the qualifications needed for this position include either a degree in Bachelor of Information Technology, Major Networking & Security, a degree in Bachelor of Computer Science, or a degree in Bachelor of Information Technology (Honours).</p>   
  
<h3 style="font-family:candara">Feedback from assignments 1 and 2</h3>

<p style="font-family:candara">From the feedback in A1 regarding the project idea, the marker mentioned about the project being well fleshed out and it also covered all of the required areas. However, there were improvements that need to be implemented, which include having a broader description of current comparable games and in-depth discussion of the technologies behind its development and running. The project idea’s description was certainly comprehensive, but it needs to have had a greater expansion in the tools and skills component (which I fixed in A2), which focuses on the backend technologies behind the MIT app inventor, identifying how they could integrate as the scope of the game creation and deployment in a briefly manner. Also, from the feedback in A2, it's a comprehensive project description of “Mini Fling It In”, which includes the extension from outline in Assignment 1. The descriptions are clear and the tools and technologies have been expanded. The information covered about what Mini Fling It In will do is very good, with excellent detail on the game build , the skills, tools and technologies. You have built a good list of market and niche needs that you can further expand on in the Assignment 3. However, even if the target market and on charge (zero) to the customer are an excellent goal though you would need to provide financial breakdown and analysis of hosting. I like the project and am looking forward to seeing an artifact for it, the programming block diagrams are a good start.</p>
