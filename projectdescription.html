<h3 style="font-family:candara">The passions, interests and skills of your group:</h3>

<p style="font-family:candara">Smart  - My passions, interests, and skills include being on a computer throughout the majority of the duration of the day. I just love everything about computers in general. It can either be in gaming, coding, practising and refining my programming skills in the likes of HTML, CSS, Java and will advance to more complex programming languages that include C++,  or Python, making YouTube videos (coming soon), and many more. I love working on a system admin/networking based IT firm after I receive my bachelors in the future. Lastly, the skills that I obtain that are IT related include making GitHub repository/pages by uploading visual elements that include images, and the use of Notepad, Visual Code Learner and Brackets to make a HTML/CSS index file (e.g. “index.html”).</p>

<p style="font-family:candara">Edward - My passions, interests, and skills are quite different; however, they all provide the capabilities I need to step further into my career. I particularly enjoy numbers, connecting the dots, and problem solving; however, it’s important for me to be able communicate well as relationship management is key in my future.</p>

<p style="font-family:candara">Although my academic life is focused on investments and applied mathematics, my intent remains set on applying my skills to solve world problems - which requires capital. This is a particular interest of mine, and I enjoy spending my time figuring things out.</p>

<p style="font-family:candara">The skills I possess that are IT-related are mathematical programming and data analytics. Most of my time is spent analysing flow, numbers, graphs, and more. The programs I need right now are Microsoft Excel, and R. These two programs allow me to perform all the work I need to understand how a business could sit at a future point in time. The skills I would like to possess include a better understanding of SQL, more advanced analytical programming skills, and e-commerce knowledge.</p>

<h3 style="font-family:candara">IT industry trends:</h3>

<p style="font-family:candara">“59% of mobile gamers download a game within a day of discovering it” (Think With Google 2018). This percentage highlights the ability for a mobile game to grow rapidly, with incredibly large target markets available world-wide. “Mini Fling It In!” is being developed to answer the needs of humanity world-wide, which currently involves mass amounts of mobile gaming. Hopefully people will love this game during the time to de-stress and have some fun after a long exhausting day. See the doughnut chart below (Knezovic, A 2020):</p>

<br>

<p style="font-family:candara">With 51% of gamers choosing mobile gaming as the favourite, “Mini Fling It In!” will be on a path of accelerated potential. Once the game is launched to the public and performing well, retention rates become important (Knezovic, A 2020). It provides valuable information on rapid prediction of player retention in free-to-play mobile games. It also states that there is a “substantial churn happening in the very beginning of gameplay”. Fortunately, “Mini Fling It In!” will be a part of a sub-wave of mobile gaming transformations.</p>

<br>

<p style="font-family:candara">Given that the “Mini Fling It In!” is a ‘Hyper-casual game’, its simplicity, minimal features, and low complexity playing level provide the relaxation needed for consumers. 2020 has proven its need and ultimately provided rapid acceleration for the sub-industry (Koetsier, J 2020). Visualised below are a few selected countries and their respective ‘hyper mobile gaming’ sessions:</p>

<p style="font-family:candara">In 2014, a paper was released which stated “while 4G Long Term Evolution (LTE) networks are being rolled out worldwide. This has been noted to document the constant attempt to improve upon even brand-new technology. In turn, this infers that one of the many continuous trends to foresee within the IT industry is the next generation mobile network. Fortunately, “Mini Fling It In!” would be directly benefited with the initial ability to provide higher quality mobile gaming. In the longer term, the purchase of the ever-changing mobile phone could continue undoubtedly, with the accumulation of more users worldwide as technology passes on from country to country (Nikaein, N, Marina, M.K, Manickam, S , Dawson, A , Knopp, R , Bonnet, C 2014).</p>

<p style="font-family:candara">In addition to the specific gaming trends, the overall IT trends will also provide many benefits. Other than 5G, there are some other trends building. This currently includes AI Driven Development, Autonomous Things, and many more (Panetta, K 2018). These are the many motivations Mini Fling It In! Foresees in the future. The game’s ability to adapt to work on any device is one of the most vital motivations as a start-up, which leads to providing the target markets necessary for sustainable growth, and the opportunity to switch to a new target market if necessary.</p>

<p style="font-family:candara">Also, the development of technical skills in terms of operating systems will definitely assist me in being a successful system admin that include desktop and server, creating an excellent overall operating environment, and the development of appropriate technical documentation knowledge in Systems protocols that include TCP/IP, DNS, DHCP, Group Policy, VOIP, Active Directory and routing protocols.</p>  
  
<p style="font-family:candara">Also, in creating an excellent operating environment, the development of appropriate technical documentation, and the experience in terms of administering the service desk and IT support ticketing systems will also assist me in being successful in my overall career plan as a system admin.</p>   
  
<p style="font-family:candara">Lastly, the qualifications needed for this position include either a degree in Bachelor of Information Technology, Major Networking & Security, a degree in Bachelor of Computer Science, or a degree in Bachelor of Information Technology (Honours).</p>   

<p style="font-family:candara">Edward - There are many objectives I have set out for myself to improve my professional career, most of which relate to analysis, programming, and communication skills. More specifically, the baseline skills most relevant to a Wealth Management career could include top-level: communication, organisation, research, problem solving, and an open view. There are many other factors necessary for professional improvement, which is all a part of the steps forward.</p>
  
<p style="font-family:candara">The technical skills to consider for a career in Wealth Management involve mathematical programming, portfolio management, advanced Microsoft Office, and some others. These are some of the important contributions one can make toward a more successful career in this field.

<h3 style="font-family:candara">Feedback from assignments 1 and 2:</h3>

<p style="font-family:candara">Smart - From the feedback in A1 regarding the project idea, the marker mentioned about the project being well fleshed out and it also covered all of the required areas. However, there were improvements that need to be implemented, which include having a broader description of current comparable games and in-depth discussion of the technologies behind its development and running. The project idea’s description was certainly comprehensive, but it needs to have had a greater expansion in the tools and skills component (which I fixed in A2), which focuses on the backend technologies behind the MIT app inventor, identifying how they could integrate as the scope of the game creation and deployment in a briefly manner. Also, from the feedback in A2, it's a comprehensive project description of “Mini Fling It In”, which includes the extension from outline in Assignment 1. The descriptions are clear and the tools and technologies have been expanded. The information covered about what Mini Fling It In will do is very good, with excellent detail on the game build , the skills, tools and technologies. It built a good list of market and niche needs that we can further expand on in Assignment 3. However, even if the target market and on charge (zero) to the customer are an excellent goal though you would need to provide financial breakdown and analysis of hosting. Overall, the project is nice and it needs an artifact for it, the programming block diagrams are a good start.</p>
