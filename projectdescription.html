<h3 style="font-family:candara">The passions, interests and skills of your group</h3>

<p style="font-family:candara">My passions, interests, and skills include being on a computer throughout the majority of the duration of the day. I just love everything about computers in general. It can either be in gaming, coding, practising and refining my programming skills in the likes of HTML, CSS, Java and will advance to more complex programming languages that include C++,  or Python, making YouTube videos (coming soon), and many more. I love working on a system admin/networking based IT firm after I receive my bachelors in the future. Lastly, the skills that I obtain that are IT related include making GitHub repository/pages by uploading visual elements that include images, and the use of Notepad, Visual Code Learner and Brackets to make a HTML/CSS index file (e.g. “index.html”).</p>
