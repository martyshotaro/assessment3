<p style="font-family:candara">As of right now, we have set roles for our team in this project idea as Smart as a Lead Developer and Edward as a Lead Marketing Analyst. However, changes may be implemented from week to week depending on the overall progress of the project. But for now, we’ll stick to our main roles.</p>

<p style="font-family:candara">Smart is in charge of planning and assisting of the timeline and the development of the product, giving constructive feedback to marketing or sales teams, and providing general design guidance, which includes the foundation and early stages of a product's development. In order for him to do that, he must possess good communication skills, a better knowledge of the product, the understanding of the business problem that’s being solved by a software, the understanding of other disciplines that include product development, management, or marketing, and a good understanding of the field of the software’s users are involved at (e.g. HR department). Lastly, it is reasonable that Smart has been elected as a Lead Developer for this project due to it being overall fleshed out and it also covered all of the required areas (e.g. overview, motivation, description, tools and techniques, and required skills). Also, the project idea’s description was certainly comprehensive. However, there were improvements that need to be implemented, which include having a broader description of current comparable games and in-depth discussion of the technologies behind its development and running, and greater expansion in the tools and skills component that focuses on the backend technologies behind the MIT app inventor, identifying how they could integrate as the scope of the game creation and deployment in a briefly manner. This was when he constructed this project idea in Assignment 1, and some improvements have been implemented in Assignment 2 and some will be implemented in the future moving forward</p>
