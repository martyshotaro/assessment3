<h3 style="font-family:candara">Roles:</h3>

<p style="font-family:candara">As of right now, we have set roles for our team in this project idea as Smart as a Lead Developer and Edward as a Lead Marketing Analyst. However, changes may be implemented from week to week depending on the overall progress of the project. But for now, we’ll stick to our main roles.</p>

<p style="font-family:candara">Smart is in charge of planning and assisting of the timeline and the development of the product, giving constructive feedback to marketing or sales teams, and providing general design guidance, which includes the foundation and early stages of a product's development. In order for him to do that, he must possess good communication skills, a better knowledge of the product, the understanding of the business problem that’s being solved by a software, the understanding of other disciplines that include product development, management, or marketing, and a good understanding of the field of the software’s users are involved at (e.g. HR department) (Hickey, J 2019). Lastly, it is reasonable that Smart has been elected as a Lead Developer for this project due to it being overall fleshed out and it also covered all of the required areas (e.g. overview, motivation, description, tools and techniques, and required skills). Also, the project idea’s description was certainly comprehensive. However, there were improvements that need to be implemented, which include having a broader description of current comparable games and in-depth discussion of the technologies behind its development and running, and greater expansion in the tools and skills component that focuses on the backend technologies behind the MIT app inventor, identifying how they could integrate as the scope of the game creation and deployment in a briefly manner. This was when he constructed this project idea in Assignment 1, and some improvements have been implemented in Assignment 2 and some will be implemented in the future moving forward.</p>

<p style="font-family:candara">As a financial market analyst, Edward is in charge of aiding the company in terms of decision-making regarding the products and services to sell. Also, its consumer target and the conclusions by studying market conditions, competitors' activities and consumer behaviour. Also, he is responsible for the data collection of the competitors’ tactics, market conditions and consumer demographics, research customers’ opinions, buying habits, preferences and wants/needs. Lastly, financial market analysts like Edward study the competition’s prices, sales numbers and the distribution and marketing methods.</p>

<h3 style="font-family:candara">Scope and limits:</h3>

<h3 style="font-family:candara">Testing:</h3>

<p style="font-family:candara">In this project, we will test our game when the lead developer will go to the “emulator” component of the MIT App Inventor as a user test. The lead developer will also go to the “emulator” and connect it to the other team member’s smartphones before uploading the game to app stores as a final product. This will also occur when there are any other concerns regarding the project (e.g. technical issues, emulator problem, and many more). Approximately we will need around 5-10 team members that specialises in different fields that include technical designer, user interface designer, and many more.</p>
