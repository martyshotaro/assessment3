<title>Group Reflection</title>

<h2 style="font-family:candara">Group Reflection (Smart Macayan)</h2>

<h3 style="font-family:candara">What went well?</h3>

<p style="font-family:candara">In my opinion, the things that went well is that we were able to get the components done as early as possible and expected, which means that we are on the right track. Also, we were able to communicate more clearly than the previous assignment via MS Teams regarding the roles of each member, components that needed to be done, current progresses, additional notes/instructions, and not being hesitant to ask confusing questions regarding the components of the assignment. The last thing that went well is the consistency of our meetings via MS Teams that results in the pace that we expect towards the completion of the assignment.</p> 

<br>

<h3 style="font-family:candara">What could be improved?</h3>

<p style="font-family:candara">In my opinion, asking the tutors via collaborate ultra or email about the hard components of this assignment should be taken advantage of on a consistent basis for a higher chance of getting good marks on the assignment. Also, the recorded minutes in our MS Teams meetings should be improved too, as it can lead to having more time discussing the content that we are expecting to tackle in a general meeting, and it can also benefit group members because more additional notes and further instructions, more information that we can take away from, which will improve our marks in this assessment. Also the commit trails for one of our members, Edward is also one of the improvements that shouldn’t be overlooked, as I’m mostly in charge of the overall actions and commits in the GitHub repository, as I’m specialise in the overall commit trails of the GitHub repository such as knowing how to upload and create files, making an “index.html” file, the programming language that will be used (in this instance, HTML), and the fonts and visual elements like pictures that will be used in the repository to make our website clean and concise for this assessment.</p>

<br>

<h3 style="font-family:candara">At least one thing that was surprising.</h3>

<p style="font-family:candara">The things that were surprising in this assessment is that Edward’s improvement in terms of overall enthusiasm and cooperation in MS Teams meetings is noticeable. This leads to making ourselves more comfortable towards the overall completion of this assessment. Also, there were times that Edward is not hesitant in asking questions regarding the confusing components of this assignment and he is taking every single advantage he can get to talk to tutors via collaborate ultra or email for further assistance.</p>

<br>

<h3 style="font-family:candara">At least one thing that you have learned about groups.</h3>

<p style="font-family:candara">A thing that we learned as a group is that we are different in terms of how to tackle components of assessment tasks in general. I’m more of a content-based individual, sticking to the books whereas Edward is more of a learning and visual based individual. This results in a diversity amongst group members in an assignment that will benefit them towards the overall completion of an assignment, instead of having group members that have the same ways of tackling assignments.</p>

<h2 style="font-family:candara">Group Reflection (Edward Glush)</h2>

<h3 style="font-family:candara">What went well?</h3>

<p style="font-family:candara">I believe the part that went the most well, was the improvement in communications. It’s quite noticeable that when two individuals work on a project, the communication is more direct at all times; whereas, with more individuals, work is more separated, and the group setting is created - with direct and indirect methods of communication. Within the span of a single feedback, and one meeting with David, the team’s communication skills altered dramatically. In my opinion, this is the greatest achievement.</p>

<br>

<h3 style="font-family:candara">What could be improved?</h3>

<p style="font-family:candara">The team could improve by allocating more long-term dates set, so that the meetings are more concrete. However, it is difficult with an under-manned group. The improvements aside from this, aren’t many. Smart’s ability to complete work on a timely and consistent manner is second to none. I can improve my ability to follow uni work, although it is difficult to learn in an unnatural way. Lastly, from a programming aspect, I need to improve my knowledge in GitHub. Thankfully, David provided the necessary website to improve these skills.</p>

<br>

<h3 style="font-family:candara">At least one thing that was surprising.</h3>

<p style="font-family:candara">What surprised me the most is Smart’s ability to stay on task and ensure the work is completed according to the rubric’s statements. The way in which work is finished under his watch is commendable. I was surprised to see such an efficient worker, as his ability to complete work was inspirational.</p>

<br>

<h3 style="font-family:candara">At least one thing that you have learned about groups.</h3>

<p style="font-family:candara">The most surprising aspect is that we were able to stay together as a team, and work through the difficulties of a group. Thankfully, I was teamed up with an enthusiastic and driven individual who has pushed my work to greater heights. Therefore, in a difficult setting, the greatest work ended up being produced. I learnt that a team of two could learn more and achieve more, than perhaps a larger group.</p>
